# About the project

*This is a R Markdown file used for the "Introduction to Open Data Science" course at the University of Helsinki in 2023. The following lines are used to excercise the R Markdown syntax.*

### not-so-random thoughts

* I am feeling quite tired at the moment, it's Friday afternoon. 
* In this course, I expect to learn a few things:
   + using tidyverse as a modern tool for R (rather than R base)
   + learn how to use GitHub since I have no experience with it
   + learn how to verson-control RStudio projects
* I saw the course in SISU and in my PhD programme (ATM-DP) [^1].
